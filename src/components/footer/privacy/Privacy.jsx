                        As part of the vehicle research and purchase process, information such as your e-mail address, name, and contact telephone numbers will be requested. This information will be used solely as described below. When entering information on this website, it is transferred automatically to our lead management system (LMS).

                        Our dealership provides for limited employee access to the LMS system. The LMS is a secured application that can only be accessed by entering a valid username and password. Once you have expressed interest in being contacted, the associate will respond through a personalized email or phone call. After the initial email contact, there may be several points of communication between you and the associate by either telephone or email. At any point in the relationship you have the option of indicating by either telephone or email that you no longer wish to be contacted by the associate. In this event, the associate will access the LMS system and mark your customer record as ''closed'', at which time, you are removed from ''active'' status.

                        The security of customer information is very important to us and we take a number of steps to safeguard it. We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards that comply with federal standards to guard non-public personal information about you. We limit access to personal and account information to those employees and agents who assist us in providing products and services to you. Employees who fail to follow our established standards are subject to disciplinary action. We also require third parties to whom we disclose nonpublic personal information to adhere to this Privacy Policy and to establish information security procedures.

                        Our dealership uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) encryption technology to protect your personal information provided on credit applications and where credit card information is required. SSL encrypts or codes this information as it travels over the Internet, and is then decoded by our dealership and its business partners who facilitate your transactions on this web site.
                        We do not read personal communications. We do not give out your telephone number, credit card information, or screen names, unless authorized to do so or as required by law.

                        You can tell if you are using a Web browser that supports SSL if a "key" or "padlock" icon appears in one of the lower corners of your screen (For example, when using Internet Explorer you will see a padlock). When you enter a secure page, the key is "un-broken" or the lock is closed. This means that your communications are now secure, encrypted, and cannot be read by non-authorized sources. Another sign that you are in a secure transaction mode is a URL that begins with "https:". When you see any of these symbols on your browser, you know that your information is protected and you can interact with the website with confidence.
